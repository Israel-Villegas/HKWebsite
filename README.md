This is a website that I started creating after being introduced to web development. We had an assignment to make a simple little website and I found it pretty fun, which caused me to look into it more. To keep myself motivated, I started making the website based around a game that I like, Hollow Knight. At the time of posting this, the website is not complete but I will update it (Nov 7, 2024).
